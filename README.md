### **Library Management System - Project Documentation**

---

#### **Project Overview**
This Library Management System (LMS) was developed as a part of our first-year, second-semester project in C++. The LMS allows users to manage book and student records efficiently. The project was developed by a team of four members, focusing on core concepts of object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction through a command-line interface.

---

#### **Core Concepts and Features**

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Classes and Objects**: The project primarily revolves around two classes - `Book` and `Student`. These classes encapsulate the data (attributes) and methods (functions) required for managing books and students.
     - **`Book` Class**: Manages details of books, including book number, name, and author.
     - **`Student` Class**: Handles student records, including admission number, name, and books issued.

2. **Encapsulation**
   - **Private Members**: Data members like `bno`, `bname`, `aname` (for books), and `admno`, `name`, `stbno`, `token` (for students) are private, ensuring they are not directly accessed from outside the class.
   - **Public Methods**: Functions like `createBook()`, `showBook()`, `modifyBook()` (in the `Book` class), and `createStudent()`, `showStudent()`, `modifyStudent()` (in the `Student` class) provide controlled access to the data.

3. **File Handling**
   - **Persistent Storage**: The project uses file handling to store book and student records in binary files (`book.dat` and `student.dat`). This allows the data to persist even after the program is closed.
   - **File Operations**: Functions such as `writeBook()`, `writeStudent()`, `displayBook()`, `displayStudent()`, `modifyBook()`, `modifyStudent()`, `deleteBook()`, and `deleteStudent()` perform various operations like reading from, writing to, modifying, and deleting records in files.

4. **User Interaction**
   - **Menus and Options**: The system presents a user-friendly command-line interface with a main menu and an administrator menu. Users can perform actions like issuing and depositing books, creating, displaying, modifying, and deleting records.
   - **Input Validation**: The program includes basic input validation and prompts the user for correct input in case of invalid entries.

5. **Modular Design**
   - **Separation of Concerns**: The project is divided into several functions, each responsible for a specific task, such as issuing a book (`bookIssue()`), depositing a book (`bookDeposit()`), or displaying all records (`displayAllBooks()` and `displayAllStudents()`).

6. **Data Integrity**
   - **Token System**: The `Student` class uses a token system to track whether a student has issued a book, preventing the issuance of multiple books without returning the previous one.
   - **Fine Calculation**: The project includes a basic fine calculation mechanism for late returns, encouraging timely deposits.

#### **Project Execution**

- **Start Function**: The project begins with the `start()` function, which introduces the system to the user with a simple title screen.
- **Main Menu**: The user is presented with a main menu offering three primary functions: Book Issue, Book Deposit, and Administrator Menu.
- **Administrator Menu**: This menu allows the user (administrator) to manage student and book records, including creating, displaying, modifying, and deleting records.

#### **Future Enhancements**
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Transitioning from a command-line interface to a graphical one for a more intuitive user experience.
- **Database Integration**: Replacing file handling with a database management system (DBMS) for better data management, security, and scalability.
- **Extended Features**: Adding features like book search by title or author, student history, and multi-user access with role-based permissions.
